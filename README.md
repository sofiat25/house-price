🏡 House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on features like bedrooms, lot size, and location using Machine Learning. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a Multiple Linear Regression model.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on key property features. The dataset was analyzed to identify the most relevant factors influencing property values.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Steps Implemented

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Selection

Model Training (Multiple Linear Regression)

Model Evaluation (R², RMSE)

▶️ How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git


Navigate to the project folder:

cd house-price-prediction


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open Jupyter Notebook and run the .ipynb file.

✅ Results

The model achieved an R² score of XX% and RMSE of XX. Feature analysis showed that size and location are the most influential factors.
